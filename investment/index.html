  <h2>Core Investment Philosophies</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Buying a company's stocks is equivalent to buying the whole company.</li>
    <li>The value of a company depends on its discounted future free cash flows.</li>
    <li>Look for securities with prices that are unjustifiably low based on their intrinsic worth.</li>
    <li>In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine.</li>
    <li>Restrict investments to businesses that can easily be analyzed.</li>
    <li>We will stick to businesses whose profit picture for decades to come seems reasonably predictable.</li>
    <li>Avoid: companies with poor economic characteristics; businesses we do not understand; companies burdened with high debt; securities with no margin of safety.</li> 
  </ol>
