	<p><i>Prospective students or post-docs who wish to work with me in the mathematics of data science and/or optimization, and, please write to my email address ( MATSYS (at) NUS.EDU.SG ).  Please also apply through <a href="https://www.math.nus.edu.sg/graduates/graduate-programme-in-mathematics-by-research/prospective-students/">this website</a> if you wish to do a PhD.</i></p>

	<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.math.nus.edu.sg/">Department of Mathematics</a> at the <a href="http://nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore (NUS)</a>.  I also hold a concurrent appointment as a Research Scientist in the <a href="http://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc">Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC)</a>.</p>

	<p>I am broadly interested in mathematical optimization and its applications to the data sciences.  I am specifically interested in developing optimization-based methodology for a range of data processing problems, as well as understanding the performance and limitations of widely used optimization-based methods in the data sciences.  My most recent projects revolve around computing structured matrix factorizations as well as the geometric task of estimating convex sets from measurements.</p>

	<p>Between Nov '18 to Dec '20, I was a Research Scientist at the Institute of High Performance Computing at A*STAR. I obtained my PhD in Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACM) from the <a href = "http://www.cms.caltech.edu/">Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS)</a> at the <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/">California Institute of Technology (Caltech)</a> in 2018. My advisor is <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~venkatc/">Venkat Chandrasekaran</a>.  Prior to that, I was as a Research Engineer at the <a href = "http://www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/">Institute for Infocomm Research</a> from 2011 to 2012 under the supervision of <a href="http://people.sutd.edu.sg/~tonyquek/">Tony Quek</a>, and also in collaboration with <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QG9iXtUAAAAJ&hl=en">Marios Kountouris</a>.  I obtained my BA in <a href = "http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/">Mathematics</a> from the <a href = "http://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a> (UK) in 2011.  </p>
